<{Proposal};
   'The website's proposal consists of using GitHub services to create repositories with a certain folder STRUCTURE together with text files in a specific text syntax to generate COMPONENTS (html/css resources) and create a kind of new webton called " LTON".';

<{Components};
   'It is possible to create components like this:';

   '{title}'text'[black;white;solid red](l);'(l){Example};

   {title}'text'[black; white; solid red](l);

   'Components are ALWAYS separated by semicolons ";".';

   'Whatever comes inside braces {} will make the title.';

   'Whatever comes inside SINGLE quotation marks '' will make up the text.';

   'It is not necessary to have both, it can just be title:';

   (l){Example}'{title}[ black; white; solid red];';

   {title}[ black; white; solid red];

   'Or just text:';

   (l){Example}''text'[ black; white; solid red];';

   'text'[black; white; solid red];

   'Whatever comes inside parentheses () will define the side:';

   (l){Example}''text'[ black; white; solid red](e);';

   'text'[black; white; solid red](e);

   'Or:';

   (l){Example}''text'[ black; white; solid red](d);';

   'text'[black; white; solid red](d);

   '(left)(left), (right)(right) || (e)(l), (d)(r).';

   'The brackets are used to define colors and styles.
   First, the background color of the component is defined, then the text color and finally the border, separated by a semicolon ";":';

   (l){Example}'{example}[red; yellow; solid green 3px];';

   {example}[red; yellow; solid green 3px];

   'It is also possible to reuse styles by saving them in a title, just start the component with an exclamation mark "!":';

   (l){Example}'![blue;#fa5]{reusing style};';

   ![blue;#fa5]{reusing style};

   'Nothing will be displayed, but now whenever you use the title"{reusing style}" it will have this styling:';

   (l){Example}''example text'{reusing style};';

   'sample text'{reusing style};

   'Styles are only valid in the chapter they were declared.';

   'It is also possible to create 'sections' that can contain other components inside, to do this you must open the section with "<;" and close with ">;". can be styled normally and can contain title :';

   (l){Example}'<{Section title}[yellow;#f5e];
   {example}(e);
   {in};
   {section}(d);
   >;';

   <{Section title}[yellow;#f5e];
   {example}(e);
   {in};
   {section}(d);

   'Sections can also contain sections:';

   '<{Section title}[yellow;#f5e];
     <{reusing style};
     {example}(e)'section within a section';
     >;
   >;';

   <{Section title}[yellow;#f5e];
   <{reusing style};
   {example}(e)'section within a section';
   >;
   >;

   'Always remember to close the sections WITH ">;".';

   'It is also possible to insert media, first the media needs to be available online, after that, just start the component with "@" and use
   embed(iframe) or
   img (image link) or
   video(video link).';

   (l){Example}
   '@img(image link);
   @video(video link);
   @embed(iframe);';

   'This type of component has no text, style or title, but can have the side defined if the parentheses come before.';

   (l){Example}
   '@(e)img(image link);
   @(d)video(video link);
   @(e)embed(iframe);';

   'And lastly, so that an inserted component is not rendered, simply place an asterisk "*" at the beginning, this avoids the need to delete them.';
