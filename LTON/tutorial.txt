<{Proposal};
   'The website's proposal consists of using GitHub services to create repositories with a certain FOLDER STRUCTURE together with text files in a specific text syntax to generate COMPONENTS and create a kind of new webton called " LTON".';
>;

<{Components};
   'It is possible to create components like this:';

   (l){Example}'{title}'text'[black;white;solid red](l)##1';

   {title}'text'[black; white; solid red](l);

   'Components are ALWAYS separated by semicolons "##1".';

   'if you want to use semicolons in the text or title, enter "#,#,1" without the commas';

   'Whatever comes inside braces {} will make the title.';

   'Whatever comes inside SINGLE quotation marks '' will make up the text.';

   'It is not necessary to have both, it can just be title:';

   (l){Example}'{title}[ black; white; solid red]##1';

   {title}[ black; white; solid red];

   'Or just text:';

   (l){Example}''text'[ black; white; solid red]##1';

   'text'[black; white; solid red];

   'Whatever comes inside parentheses () will define the side:';

   (l){Example}''text'[ black; white; solid red](e)##1';

   'text'[black; white; solid red](e);

   'Or:';

   (l){Example}''text'[ black; white; solid red](d)##1';

   'text'[black; white; solid red](d);

   '(l)(left), (right)(r) || (e)(d).';

   'The brackets are used to define colors and styles.
   First, the background color of the component is defined, then the text color and finally the border, separated by a semicolon "##1":';

   (l){Example}'{example}[red; yellow; solid green 3px]##1';

   {example}[red; yellow; solid green 3px];

   'It is also possible to reuse styles by saving them in a title, just start the component with an exclamation mark "!":';

   (l){Example}'![blue;#fa5]{reusing style}##1';

   ![blue;#fa5]{reusing style};

   'Nothing will be displayed, but now whenever you use the title"{reusing style}" it will have this styling:';

   (l){Example}''example text'{reusing style}##1';

   'example text'{reusing style};

   'The styles registered in the titles are valid only in the chapter in which they were declared.';

   'Styles marked directly in the component override title styles.';

   'It is also possible to create 'sections' that can contain other components inside, to do this you must open the section with "<;" and close with ">;". can be styled normally and can contain title :';

   (l){Example}'<{Section title}[yellow;#f5e]##1
   {example}(e)##1
   {in}##1
   {section}(d)##1
   >##1';

   <{Section title}[yellow;#f5e];
   {example}(e);
   {in};
   {section}(d);
   >;

   'Sections can also contain sections:';

   (l){Example}
   '<{Section title}[yellow;#f5e]##1
     <{reusing style}##1
     {example}(e)'section within a section'##1
     >##1
   >##1';

   <{Section title}[yellow;#f5e];
   <{reusing style};
   {example}(e)'section within a section';
   >;
   >;

   'Always remember to close the sections WITH ">##1".';

   'It is also possible to insert media, first the media needs to be available online, after that, just start the component with "@" and use
   embed(iframe) or
   img (image link) or
   video(video link).';

   (l){Example}
   '@img(image link)##1
   @video(video link)##1
   @embed(iframe)##1';

   'This type of component has no text, style or title, but can have the side defined if the parentheses come before.';

   (l){Example}
   '@(e)img(image link)##1
   @(d)video(video link)##1
   @(e)embed(iframe)##1';

   'And lastly, so that an inserted component is not rendered, simply place an asterisk "*" at the beginning, this avoids the need to delete them.';

   (l){Example}'*'text'{title}##1';

<{Repository folder structure};
   'The main branch will always be used, and the repository must be public.';

   'The repository must contain a folder called LTON in its root, which will be used to render the content.'{LTON};

   'Each chapter corresponds to a text file with the extension ".txt", the file name is the name of the chapter.';

   'Chapters can be grouped by folders, the name of the grouping is the name of the folder.';

   'If the file name is "_styles.txt" or "_estilos.txt" it will not be displayed, but it may contain styles that persisted across all pages.';

   'We recommend creating a file "autor.txt" or "author.txt" that contains your contacts, social networks and forms of support such as pix, payoneer, paypal...';

   {config.json};

   'You need a "config.json" file in the root of the LTON folder with an object with three keys:'

   '"cover" , if you expect a link to image.';

   '"genre" , if one of the types contained in the catalog filter is expected (lowercase).';

   '"lang", specify the language ex:"en","pt-br"...';

   (l){Example}'{
         "genre":"action",
         "cover":"https://linktoimg",
         "lang":"en"
   }';

   'This image and genre will be used to display your LTON in the catalog, https://www.LTON.com/catalog.html, your LTON will not necessarily be there, the catalog shows the recently most accessed LTONs.';
  
   'After creating a LTON repository, simply access "https://www.LTON.com/#github profile name:repository name" and if you have the syntax and folder structure correct, it will now be displayed.';

   'Disclose your LTON link on your social media.';

   'Your LTON can be updated at any time, just “push” to your github repository, the content will be updated within a day.';

   'In advance, I would like to thank those who decided to develop their LTON and especially those who decided to support the idea, each donation, even if they are symbolic amounts, makes this project possible. ';
